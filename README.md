## _Why am I taking this course?_
  Well... The short answer is that I don't have enough credits and was facing the danger of underload... All other courses were either already full, or conflicts in time, or have a pre-requisite I didn't meet.
  So at the second week, I went to the Class Schedule & Quota site and found this course with very loose pre-requisite and a lot of available quota! And I surprisingly found Prof. Meng to be so young hahaha! (When I first saw his photo I thought this is a student or a TA lol)  And more surprisingly, he's got an A+ ranking on UST randkings!
  Then I just decided to enroll ASAP. 
  During the time when I was going through the course website and slides to catch on the previous ones, I was getting assured by the fun stuff the fun way that prof teaches and speaks, that I've made the right choice by enrolling into this course!

## _What's this website for?_
  Well... Initially it's just a homework requirement. But maybe I should grasp this chance to record something interesting from this course and maybe some of my thoughts during this amazing journey ( as I'm sure it would be! )
  So maybe I would choose it to be a kind of diary to record my progress of this course!
  And I really hope this won't be too foggy for me and I can really grasp the important ideas deeply in mind!</h3>
