About Me
  Hellooooo! My name is Wan Meien, and you can also call me Mary. I'm currently a year 2 student majoring in Electronic Engineering. 
  A little something about my hobbies: I LOVE sports! And badminton is my FAVOURITE! I also enjoy many others like tennis, table tennis, hiking and so on...

Why am I taking this course?
  Well... The short answer is that I don't have enough credits and was facing the danger of underload... All other courses were either already full, or conflicts in time, or have a pre-requisite I didn't meet.
  So at the second week, I went to the Class Schedule & Quota site and found this course with very loose pre-requisite and a lot of available quota! And I surprisingly found Prof. Meng to be so young hahaha! (When I first saw his photo I thought this is a student or a TA lol)  And more surprisingly, he's got an A+ ranking on UST randkings!
  Then I just decided to enroll ASAP. 
  During the time when I was going through the course website and slides to catch on the previous ones, I was getting assured by the fun stuff the fun way that prof teaches and speaks, that I've made the right choice by enrolling into this course!

What's this website for?
  Well... Initially it's just a homework requirement. But 来都来了，maybe I should grasp this chance to record something interesting from this course and maybe some of my thoughts during this amazing journey ( as I'm sure it would be! )
  So maybe I would choose it to be a kind of diary to record my progress of this course!
  And I really hope this won't be too foggy for me and I can really grasp the important ideas deeply in mind!
